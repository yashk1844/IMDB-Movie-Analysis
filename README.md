# IMDB-Movie-Analysis

Problem Statement:-
                    Based on the massive movie information, it would be interesting to understand, what are the important factors that make a movie more successful than others? So, we would like to analyse what kind of movies are more successful, in other words, get higher IMDB score. 
In this project, we take IMDB scores as response variable and focus on operating predictions by analysing the rest of variables in the IMDB movie dataset. The results can help film companies to understand the secret of generating a commercial success movie.
